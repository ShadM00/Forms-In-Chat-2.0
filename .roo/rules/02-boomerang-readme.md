# 🧠 Roocoder + Boomerang Task Onboarding for FormsInChat

This project uses **Boomerang Tasks** to drive the development of a $1M+ SaaS product, **FormsInChat**.

## ✅ How to Start

1. Place all files in your `.roo/rules/` directory.
2. GPT-4.1 agents will auto-load these rules.
3. Start with Task `InitializeContextMemory`
4. Proceed sequentially through the Boomerang system.

## 🔁 Task Overview

- `InitializeContextMemory`: Boot up GPT-4.1 with FormsInChat context
- `SetupMonorepoProjectStructure`: Turbo repo + Tailwind + CI
- `BuildLandingPageComponents`: Hero, Navbar, CTA, Footer, etc.
- `ImplementGeminiAgents`: AI logic for prompt > schema
- `BuildFormPersistenceAndExport`: Save/share/export form logic
- `IntegrateAnalyticsHooks`: Track CTA buttons and flows
- `BuildAndDeployCIInfra`: CI/CD + deployment pipelines

## 📌 Tips
- CONTEXT is always loaded into agent memory
