# 🙏 FormsInChat Manifesto: Engineering Edition

Inspired by Acts 20:35 & Luke 6:38

We build FormsInChat not just as a product, but as a **tool of service**.
This is a world-class application with a Kingdom-first foundation.

## Engineering Guidelines

- ✝️ Bless before you bill
- 🧠 Teach before you tell
- ❤️ Love before you launch
- 🤝 Help before you harvest
- 🎁 Give before you ask

## Every task, component, and feature must answer:

- What value are we giving first?
- Who are we helping?
- How can we overdeliver generously?
- What would excellence look like if it was led by love?

> “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” – Acts 20:35
